# Demo-Money-Transaction-System API Integration Testing
## Project Summery
###### The Demo Money Transaction System simulates a simplified financial service platform involving four types of users: Admin, Agent, Customer, and Merchant. The process begins with the Admin creating an Agent, two Customers, and a Merchant within the system. The Admin then allocates an initial fund from the system account to the Agent, enabling the Agent to perform financial operations on behalf of the system. The Agent uses this fund to deposit money into one of the Customers' accounts, allowing them to initiate transactions. Customers can send money to each other, withdraw funds through the Agent, and make payments to Merchants. Each transaction updates the respective account balances and generates transaction statements that can be viewed using a transaction ID. The flow ensures that each role demonstrates their core functionalityâ€”Agents handle deposits and withdrawals, Customers engage in peer-to-peer transfers and payments, and Merchants receive payments for goods or services. The system thus models a complete cycle of money movement in a digital financial ecosystem.
